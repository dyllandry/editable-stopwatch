I'm following this right now: [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows#install-nvm-windows-nodejs-and-npm)

From above:

> Using Node.js directly on Windows is great for learning and experimenting with what you can do. Once you are ready to build production-ready web apps, which are typically deployed to a Linux-based server, we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 (WSL 2) for developing Node.js web apps. Many Node.js packages and frameworks are created with a *nix environment in mind and most Node.js apps are deployed on Linux, so developing on WSL ensures consistency between your development and production environments. To set up a WSL dev environment, see Set up your Node.js development environment with WSL 2.

Maybe if things start to break I can follow [Install Node.js on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl)
